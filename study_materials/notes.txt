1. The correct value for Interface can be found in game by running the following command: `/run print((select(4, GetBuildInfo())));`

2. How to debug? While you are developing it will be useful to stay logged into the game. This allows you to switch in and out to make some changes to the addon, run `/reload` to restart the UI and continue debugging. Majority of the time your changes will be reflected unless you are doing something with changing files names or the toc file. It will also be useful to execute `/console scriptErrors 1` during your coding session so that when Lua errors occur they are displayed immediately. Just donâ€™t forget to turn it off using `/console scriptErrors 0` before you go back to normal gameplay. As always, `print` and `message` functions will be your friend!
